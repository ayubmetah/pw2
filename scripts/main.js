Initialize State
At the moment the web app's button is disabled and can't be clicked. This is because it's good practice to disable the push button by default and enable it once you know push is supported and can know if the user is currently subscribed or not.

Let's create two functions in scripts/main.js, one called initializeUI, which will check if the user is currently subscribed, and one called updateBtn which will enable our button and change the text if the user is subscribed or not.

We want our initializeUI function to look like this:

Add the following code to implement the updateBtn() function.

	One thing that we haven't handled yet is what happens if the user blocks the permission request. This needs some unique consideration because if the user blocks the permission, our web app will not be able to re-show the permission prompt and will not be able to subscribe the user, so we need to at least disable the push button so the user knows it can't be used.
	The obvious place for us to handle this scenario is in the updateBtn() function. All we need to do is check the Notification.permission value, like so:
